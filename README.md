# Ruby-parser-using-python
- Using python's *ply* library, I have built a python program that takes in your input(Ruby source code) and tokenizes it.
- Parses through the source code and checks if the given input is syntacticallly correct.
- The myLex.py file defiens the tokens and keywords.
- While myYacc.py file defines the grammar of the language (ruby) which evaluates the input.

### How to run
- Run the myLex.py file first, to ensure all the tokens are defined.
- And then, run the myYacc.py file which shall run in the terminal for as many iterations as you like.
